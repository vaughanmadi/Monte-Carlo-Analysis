# Senior-Design
This repository holds relevant code I have written for my Senior Design project. These scripts in particular are for an assignment where I did a Monte Carlo analysis of the effects of the J2 oblateness perturbation on randomly generated positions for a spacecraft in LEO. I generated these positions according to both a Gaussian and Uniform distribution to observe which method yielded less error in the subsequent acceleration perturbation estimation.
